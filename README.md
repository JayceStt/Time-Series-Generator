# Time Series Generator and FFT Filter

A Python/Jupyter Notebook project for generating synthetic time-series signals made from multiple sinusoidal components, adding optional white noise, and applying frequency-domain filters using the Fast Fourier Transform.

This project demonstrates basic signal generation, spectral analysis, and digital filtering concepts using `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`.

---

## Overview

This notebook allows the user to build a custom time-series signal by choosing:

* Number of sinusoidal components
* Start and end time
* Frequencies
* Amplitudes
* Phases
* Optional white noise

After generating the signal, the notebook displays the data in both the time domain and frequency domain. The user can then apply different FFT-based filters to modify the signal.

## Features

* Generate a time-series from multiple sine waves
* Choose random, preset, or manual values for:

  * Frequency
  * Amplitude
  * Phase
* Add optional white noise
* Plot the generated signal in the time domain
* Compute and plot the power spectral density
* Apply custom frequency-domain filters:

  * High-pass filter
  * Low-pass filter
  * Band-pass filter
* Reset the filtered signal back to the original signal
* Compare original and filtered signals visually

## Sampling Configuration

The notebook uses a fixed sampling interval:

```python
SampF = 0.01
```

This means the time step between samples is:

```text
Δt = 0.01 seconds
```

This corresponds to a sampling frequency of:

```text
fs = 1 / Δt = 100 Hz
```

The Nyquist frequency is therefore:

```text
f_Nyquist = 50 Hz
```

This is why the generated random frequencies are selected between 0 Hz and 50 Hz.

## How It Works

### 1. Input Parameters

The user is prompted to enter the number of sinusoids and the time range for the signal.

The notebook then asks whether frequency, amplitude, and phase values should be:

* Randomly generated
* Automatically set
* Manually entered

---

### 2. Signal Generation

Each sinusoidal component is generated using:

```python
A * sin(2πft + φ)
```

where:

| Symbol | Meaning   |
| ------ | --------- |
| `A`    | Amplitude |
| `f`    | Frequency |
| `t`    | Time      |
| `φ`    | Phase     |

The final signal is built by summing all sinusoidal components together.

Optional white noise can also be added to the generated signal.

---

### 3. Frequency Analysis

The notebook uses the Fast Fourier Transform to analyze the signal in the frequency domain.

The power spectral density is calculated from the FFT result and displayed in decibels:

```python
psd = abs(fft_series) ** 2 / n
psd_db = 10 * log10(psd)
```

This allows the frequency components of the generated signal to be visualized clearly.

---

### 4. Filtering

The notebook supports three main filtering operations.

| Filter Type | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| High-pass   | Attenuates frequencies below a cutoff     |
| Low-pass    | Attenuates frequencies above a cutoff     |
| Band-pass   | Keeps frequencies within a selected range |

The filters are applied in the frequency domain by multiplying the FFT of the signal by a custom filter response. The filtered signal is then converted back to the time domain using the inverse FFT.

## Example Workflow

1. Run the notebook.
2. Enter the number of sine waves to generate.
3. Choose the time range.
4. Select random, set, or manual parameters.
5. Add optional white noise.
6. View the time-domain signal.
7. View the frequency-domain power spectrum.
8. Apply a high-pass, low-pass, or band-pass filter.
9. Compare the original and filtered signals.
